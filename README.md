# PLAYSMART - My first Website Ever
For the first semester project of the course ICT, I created my first ever website with help of my groupmates called Playsmart which is made using HTML and CSS. The aim is to provide a platform for users to play and learn about gaming in a fun manner as well as making them knowledgable about potential impacts of extreme gaming.
