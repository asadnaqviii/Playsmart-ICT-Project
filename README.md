# PLAYSMART - My first Website Ever
For the first semester project of the course ICT, I created my first ever website with help of my groupmates called Playsmart which is made using HTML and CSS. The aim is to provide a platform for users to play and learn about gaming in a fun manner as well as making them knowledgable about potential impacts of extreme gaming.
## URL
I have also hosted this website on Netlify and you can access it through this link: [(https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1136761/17080297/1bccbd60-512a-11e6-89cb-c6c112270154.png)](https://playsmart-ict.netlify.app/)

# About
-Playsmart- This project is about creating a website, which encourages people to play games in a fun and healthy way, by being aware of everything that is related to gaming in a virtual environment. It also let users experience the various types of games they are playing and how are they being made. Our purpose is to let the users know about what is being played by them and its physical and psychological impacts. We let the users know about the technical aspects in creating and running a videogame and many of the platforms being used to run videogames. 
# Motivation
Almost 2 and half billion people are playing games worldwide. They deserve to know what type of content they are being exposed to and how can they be affected by it, in potentially, both negative and positive ways. However, we aim to provide a more robust approach so that the players get to enjoy games in a safe manner with a peace of mind.
Every genre of gaming provides insight, and it can be both helpful and harmful for your well-being. Therefore, Playsmart consists of 2 main focus points; the video games, and how each genre of games affects the player.
# How it works
We aim to create a website that will allow a user-friendly interaction by the help of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as some other 3rd party software for game development. 
#Future work
This website will continue to improve with the passage of time. More content shall be added as we continue to have more knowledge about software and networking. This website will provide users a platform to interact with each other in a fun and healthy way. This will encourage learning. People will be allowed to share their ideas and content of their own interests in a friendly environment. We will provide a better way for users to keep track of their activities on the website.
